- Modularity: Design with loosely coupled components/microservices for independent development, deployment, and scaling.
- Scalability: Plan for horizontal and vertical scaling. Utilize auto-scaling cloud resources and stateless services.
- Security: Implement robust authentication & authorization (e.g., OAuth2, OIDC), data encryption (at rest and in transit), input validation, output encoding, and regular security audits (SAST/DAST). Follow the principle of least privilege.
- APIs: Design clear, well-documented, versioned, and secure APIs (RESTful or GraphQL) for internal and external integrations. Consider API gateways.
- Observability: Integrate comprehensive logging (structured logs), monitoring (metrics for performance, errors, resource usage), and alerting systems.
- User Experience (UX): Prioritize intuitive navigation, responsive design across devices, accessibility (WCAG compliance), and fast load times.
- Data Management: Choose appropriate database solutions (SQL/NoSQL) based on data characteristics, access patterns, consistency requirements (CAP theorem), and scalability needs. Ensure data integrity and backup strategies.
- Resilience & Availability: Design for fault tolerance with redundancy, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery plans. Aim for high availability (e.g., 99.99%).
- CI/CD: Implement automated testing (unit, integration, E2E) and deployment pipelines for rapid and reliable releases.
- Cost Optimization: Regularly review resource usage and select cost-effective services. Implement auto-shutdown for non-production environments.`;

  prompt: \`You are an expert AI Platform Architect and Optimization Specialist. Your task is to analyze the provided platform configuration/description and its intended use case to suggest comprehensive improvements.

Platform Configuration / Description:
{{{platformConfiguration}}}

Intended Use Case / Platform Type:
{{{intendedUseCase}}}

To provide relevant and actionable recommendations, you have access to the 'getPlatformDesignBestPractices' tool. Use this tool by providing the '{{{intendedUseCase}}}' to gather standard architectural and design best practices for this type of platform. Integrate insights from the tool's output into your suggestions.

Based on all the information (platform configuration/description, use case, and insights from the 'getPlatformDesignBestPractices' tool):
1.  **Architectural Suggestions**: Provide specific, actionable recommendations for improving the platform's overall architecture. Consider:
    *   Modularity (e.g., microservices vs. monolith, component design).
    *   Data flow and inter-service communication.
    *   Potential bottlenecks or single points of failure.
    *   Technology stack choices (if implied or if alternatives are clearly better).
    *   API design considerations.
2.  **Component Suggestions**: Analyze the components mentioned or implied. Suggest:
    *   Specific UI components (or backend components/services) that would be suitable.
    *   Improved configurations for existing/implied components.
    *   Alternative components for better UX, performance, or maintainability.
3.  **Performance Optimizations**: Identify potential performance issues. Suggest optimizations like:
    *   Data loading strategies (e.g., lazy loading, pagination, GraphQL query optimization).
    *   Caching mechanisms (client-side, CDN, server-side, database).
    *   Efficient component rendering techniques.
    *   Database query optimizations or schema adjustments for read/write performance.
4.  **Scalability Enhancements**: Based on the use case, suggest how the platform could be better designed or modified for scalability to handle future growth in users, data volume, or feature complexity. Consider database scaling, stateless services, message queues, etc.
5.  **Redesign Ideas (Optional)**: If significant improvements can be made or complex future needs are identified (e.g., integration of AI, major new features), propose conceptual redesign ideas for specific parts of the platform or the overall user experience. Explain how these redesigns address the problems or unlock new capabilities.
6.  **Reasoning**: For all major suggestions, clearly explain the reasoning. Articulate why the suggested change will improve the platform, how it addresses specific problems (even if not explicitly stated but implied by the configuration/use case), and how it aligns with best practices (reference the tool's output where relevant).

Format your response strictly according to the output schema. Ensure all relevant fields are populated appropriately.
If the platform configuration is very sparse or abstract, focus on providing general best practices relevant to the use case and how one might start structuring such a platform, drawing heavily from the tool's output.
Be specific and provide concrete examples where possible.
