Use this tool by providing the '{{{intendedUseCase}}}' to gather standard architectural and design best practices for this type of platform. Integrate insights from the tool's output into your suggestions.\n\n" +
    "Based on all the information (platform configuration/description, use case, and insights from the 'getPlatformDesignBestPractices' tool):\n" +
    "1.  **Architectural Suggestions**: Provide specific, actionable recommendations for improving the platform's overall architecture. Consider:\n" +
    '    *   Modularity (e.g., microservices vs. monolith, component design).\n' +
    '    *   Data flow and inter-service communication.\n' +
    '    *   Potential bottlenecks or single points of failure.\n' +
    '    *   Technology stack choices (if implied or if alternatives are clearly better).\n' +
    '    *   API design considerations.\n' +

    '    *   Specific UI components (or backend components/services) that would be suitable.\n' +
    '    *   Improved configurations for existing/implied components.\n' +
    '    *   Alternative components for better UX, performance, or maintainability.\n' +
    '3.  **Performance Optimizations**: Identify potential performance issues. Suggest optimizations like:\n' +
    '    *   Data loading strategies (e.g., lazy loading, pagination, GraphQL query optimization).\n' +
    '    *   Caching mechanisms (client-side, CDN, server-side, database).\n' +
    '    *   Efficient component rendering techniques.\n' +
    '    *   Database query optimizations or schema adjustments for read/write performance.\n' +
    '4.  **Scalability Enhancements**: Based on the use case, suggest how the platform could be better designed or modified for scalability to handle future growth in users, data volume, or feature complexity. Consider database scaling, stateless services, message queues, etc.\n' +
    '5.  **Redesign Ideas (Optional)**: If significant improvements can be made or complex future needs are identified (e.g., integration of AI, major new features), propose conceptual redesign ideas for specific parts of the platform or the overall user experience. Explain how these redesigns address the problems or unlock new capabilities.\n' +
    "6.  **Reasoning**: For all major suggestions, clearly explain the reasoning. Articulate why the suggested change will improve the platform, how it addresses specific problems (even if not explicitly stated but implied by the configuration/use case), and how it aligns with best practices (reference the tool's output where relevant).\n\n" +
