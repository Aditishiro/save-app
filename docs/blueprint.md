# **App Name**: FormFlow Finance

## Core Features:

- Form Builder: Drag-and-drop interface for building forms with standard financial field types (text, number, dropdown, date, file upload).
- Conditional Logic: Conditional logic editor to dynamically show/hide fields based on user inputs, enhancing the relevance of forms. Simplified interface focused on financial use cases.
- AI Form Optimizer: AI-powered tool for suggesting optimal field configurations based on the intended use-case, leveraging machine learning to identify potential errors in form layout or data validation.
- Preview and Versioning: Preview mode to test form functionality and validation rules. Real-time validation feedback. Versioning system to track changes and revert to previous versions.
- Access and Publishing: Role-based access control (Viewer, Editor, Publisher). Publishing workflow with draft and published states.

## Style Guidelines:

- Card-based layout for form elements and options, with clear separation between the main navigation panel, form builder workspace, conditional logic panel, and preview section. Tab-based or sidebar navigation for 'My Forms,' 'Templates,' 'Submissions,' 'Settings,' and 'Integrations'.
- Neutral color palette (gray, white) with green highlights for validated fields, red for errors. Muted backgrounds for content containers to improve focus.
- Accent: Use a desaturated blue (#60A5FA) for interactive elements like buttons, links, and active tabs. This will provide a subtle but noticeable visual cue.
- Use clear and professional typography. Ensure that field labels are easily distinguished from input fields, and that error messages are prominent and easy to understand.
- Use a consistent set of icons to represent different form elements and actions (e.g., a pencil icon for editing, a plus icon for adding, etc.) Icons should be simple and easy to recognize.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions (e.g., a slight fade-in when a field is added to the form, a smooth transition when switching between tabs, etc.). Animations should be functional and avoid distractions.
